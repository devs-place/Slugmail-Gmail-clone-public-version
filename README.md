# Slugmail-Gmail-clone-public-version
This is a public facing version of my slugmail-Gmail clone project with no source code.
a work in progress/tested build of slugmail.

This is a fullstack gmail clone.
- For this project I utilized React framework, and Material-UI components for front-end UI.
* I used Node and express to initiate a server that exposes an authenticated OpenAPI restricted RESTful interface which queries data stored
in a containerized PostgreSQL database.
+ This saved 50% of my time as I could write the backend and frontend in javascript, rather 
* I developed comprehensive tests for front-end UI using MSW, and Testing-Library, back-end API using Supertest,
and Jest, and end-to-end tests that utilized the full-stack of the application using Puppeteer and achieved 100% code coverage across all stacks.
